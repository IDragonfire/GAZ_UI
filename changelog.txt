Version 8: SCU Manager Preset Config Manager (right click on Combat or Eng icon near Idle SCU) fixed for Cybran, UEF and Seraphim (by Dragonfire)

Version 6: Thanks to ghaleon for many additional modules (see the posted readme below), and for doing most of the work for this release. Also thanks to Thygrrr for Smart Economy Indicators, and for nice Strat Build Icons to replace my fugly ones. :D

Version 5: Thanks to norem, we now have the very excellent Factory Build Queues feature! You can now turn off the "seperate icon for idle engineers" feature via the options menu. Also I've written some proper docs in the README.txt. It's still WIP tho.

Version 4: Sorry, missed some search & replaces, SCUManager was still referencing the old mod. Get this new version.

Version 3 is released! Ignore v2, it was a false upload :P
- Added norem's hotkeys - Idle engineers in selection now uses Idle icon rather than low fuel (thanks norem!)
- Idle icon will now appear even if you dont have "Larger Strat Icons" enabled.
- Fixed some bugs.

Version 1: The main new features for this first release is:
- The units in the selection window will now be consistently sorted. If you right click to remove some they will no longer randomly reorder themselves.
- Idle construction units (factories, engineers, (s)ACUs) will now be seperated from active ones in the selection window. The idle units will be marked with an "out of fuel" icon.
- The "larger strategic icons" for the build window. I've replaced Goom's nice ones with ugly rescaled ones from the "resized strat icons" mod. The reason for this is that the ugly ones contain the Tech Level dots beneath the icons, useful to differentiate engineers etc.
